interpreter
======
Purpose
-------
Provides a reference interpreter for the language. It's fairly dependent upon the underlying Python
processing model for speed and cleanliness, and it's fail-fast in the event of problems. It keeps
track of the current statement and scope-level to provide some semblance of a traceback in the
event of an exception.


Notes
-----
At various points in this module, the following anti-pattern will appear::
    generator = <some-generator>
    for prompt in generator:
        x = yield prompt
        generator.send(x)
        
This is needed to support the coroutine-oriented design of the language this reference interpreter
is meant to provide. The reason for this is that externally registered functions may need to block
for asynchronous events and it's necessary to retain the state of the interpreter's environment
until the event has completed. Building a recursive message-passing chain using generators as
coroutine-handlers seemed like the most externally clean and structurally sound method, but it
added a lot of seemingly duplicated code (that three-line chunk) that, as far as I can fathom,
cannot be simplified, since the generator's evaluation has to take place within the scope of the
executing function. It seems like an acceptable tradeoff, though, since the language will be
primarily extended through library-injection, not syntax/semantics augmentation (automatic Python
type-marshalling makes it easy to define new data-structures and access-methods as language
extensions), so only one or two dedicated maintance programmers will ever be touching this file at a
time.

If you wish to repurpose this interpreter for a simpler, purely synchronous library, most instances
of the anti-pattern can be easily replaced with ``x = <some-generator>``. If you do it right, all
unit tests should pass if you make the indicated changes to ``test_sources/__init__.py`` and disable
the ``coroutine`` testcases in the driver.


Another anti-pattern, in the form of flow-control through exceptions, manifests itself for handling
messages that need to transcend scope. Fortunately, they do not pervade outside of this module, and
they are used quite consistently within. They are necessary because it is impossible to both yield
to a co-routine and return an explicit value, so it came down to either having a loose standard of
treating the last-yielded value of a function as its return-value (very, very error-prone and
hard-to-follow) or wrapping them in exception-types and unwrapping them at the appropriate level of
control. Once observed, the process of tracing them should be simple (hint: they're attached to
every coroutine entry-point, which means if you search for 'yield', you'll find them all and know
how to add them when expanding). The overhead associated with exception-handling in Python is
marginal compared to most other languages, owing to its namespace-oriented design, so there's no
real penalty to handling things this way, other than being a bit of a slap in Martin Fowler's face,
but I don't really like his preachy tone anyway. (Even though he's right about most things when
thinking in a Gosling-like mindset, but this is more Kay's domain, so the rules are a fair bit
different)


Standard usage
--------------
It may seem counter-intuitive, but callers will need to respect the couroutine design and brace
themselves for exceptions used as flow-control mechanisms. (It's cleaner than having a ton of
state-management logic everywhere. Seriously. I would not envy anyone who had to maintain the first
draft).

If calling a node directly::
    node = interpreter.execute_node('my_sweet_node')
    exit_value = None
    try:
        for prompt in node:
            #This could be a series of calls made over a long period of time, rather than a loop.
            if prompt == ('scope.subscope.function', 1): #Some function, somewhere, wants data.
                node.send(prompt[1]) #What you send back is up to your function's needs.
    except StatementExit as e:
        #Not guaranteed to occur; if not encountered, no ``exit`` statement was reached.
        exit_value = e.value
        
If calling a function directly::
    function = interpreter.execute_function('my_awesome_function', {'l33t': 1337,})
    return_value = None
    try:
        for prompt in function:
            #This could be a series of calls made over a long period of time, rather than a loop.
            if prompt == ('scope.subscope.function', 1): #Some function, somewhere, wants data.
                node.send(prompt[1]) #What you send back is up to your function's needs.
    except StatementExit as e:
        #This is not guaranteed to occur; if not encountered, no ``exit`` statement was reached
        print(exit_value)
    except StatementReturn as e:
        #This, however, will always occur, unless ``StatementExit`` is encountered.
        return_value = e.value
        
        
External functions
------------------
For the most part, designing an external function for registration is a simple process: just write
a function as you normally would, give it descriptive parameter-names, and pass it into
`Interpreter.register_scoped_functions()`. You can return a value if you want, including a tuple or
list.

If you want to make use of the coroutine architecture, things are a bit more complex, but they're
not too bad.

In this case, your function needs to be a generator, so it has to ``yield`` a prompt so the
controller knows what to do in response. The identifier used to register your function will
automatically be exposed, so the origin is given for free.

Your function will receive a response to its ``yield`` using ``send()``, which can be used to decide
how to proceed. Upon completion, your function may either end without doing anything (implicit
``None`` return) or it can raise an instance of this module's ``StatementReturn`` exception, in the
following way: ``raise prismscript.processor.interpreter.StatementReturn('Your Return Value')``,
which will cause the given value to be returned.

You may return a generator object using the ``StatementReturn`` method, but you cannot return one
using the ``return`` method.

You also have access to ``StatementExit`` to halt execution, but that should generally be left to
script-writers.


Consider using the ``discover_functions`` module to easily build a big list of functions that can be
quickly passed to every new interpreter instance in a sensible format.


Warning
-------
Before attempting to modify this module, make sure you are well-versed in coroutine theory. Failure
to respect that model will lead to pain. Lots of it. You will cry and people will hate you. It will
be bad.

David Beazley's articles on the subject (and a number of other topics) are pretty comprehensive and
may prove to be a good place to start: http://www.dabeaz.com/coroutines/

He is also, by pure coincidence, the author of the library that handles parsing of the language's
grammar.
