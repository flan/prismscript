interpreter
======
Purpose
-------
Provides a reference interpreter for the language. It's fairly dependent upon the underlying Python
processing model for speed and cleanliness, and it's fail-fast in the event of problems. It keeps
track of the current statement and scope-level to provide some semblance of a traceback in the
event of an exception.
