parser
======
Purpose
-------
Digests a well-formed source file and provides a recursive tree to traverse, making it possible to
bind semantics to an arbitrary encapsulation of language elements.

Using this module, you could build a compiler or interpreter for the language, making it actually do
things.

    Digests a script as ``source`` and provides a (``nodes``, ``functions``) tuple as output:

    - ``nodes``: A dictionary of ``name``:``expressionlist`` items
    - ``functions``: A dictionary of (``name``, ``parameters``):``expressionlist`` items

    ``name`` is always a string, ``parameters`` is always a frozenset of strings, and
    ``expressionlist`` items are any type of interpretable expression, as described in the
    programming guide.

    An invalid script will never be partially salvaged by this routine. If something is illegal,
    `ValueError` will be raised.
